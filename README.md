## Intro

I work on Tesla’s Cell Manufacturing team, where I lead a team that builds software to enable more efficient manufacturing operations. My team runs the data platform reponsible for [factory reporting](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1798472011678966221) and [financial tracking](https://electrek.co/2024/04/24/tesla-expects-4680-battery-cells-cheaper-than-suppliers-end-of-year/).

I hope that my current work will pull forward the day when the world has access to cheap, abundant energy storage.

My technical interests include analytical data systems (particularly Spark and data lakes), stream processing, data validation and verifiability, and data visualization. I enjoy thinking about how data tools can improve operations in large organizations.



I previously studied Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley. My academic background is in materials research for high-capacity, nickel-rich battery cathodes.

Outside of work, I’m interested in global development, particularly how to most effectively lift out of poverty the [650 million people living on less than $2.15 per day](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY). I’m also broadly interested in the [safety and alignment of AI systems](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rJRw78oihoT5paFGd/high-level-hopes-for-ai-alignment).

Away from the keyboard, I enjoy road cycling, mountain biking, running, hiking/backpacking, and photography.

I live in the Bay Area, where I was also born and raised.

## Code

I've focused on work projects over personal projects for the past few years -- here's a snapshot of my contribution graph within Tesla during that time. (Tacky I know, but I've been asked about it before.)

If you're interested in reading some of my code, I have a handful of older personal projects here:
- I taught myself TypeScript and React over a month during Covid, and I built [batterycost.me](https://batterycost.me/) ([repo](https://github.com/ewoodbury/battery-cost-app))
- I learned Go and built a basic web framework benchmark suite ([repo](https://github.com/ewoodbury/web-framework-tests))
